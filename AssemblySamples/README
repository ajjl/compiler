Compilation intructions:
Must be done on ARM machine

assemble and thien link.
taken from: http://thinkingeek.com/2013/01/09/arm-assembler-raspberry-pi-chapter-1/

ex. for first.s:
```
as -o first.o first.s
gcc -o first first.o
```
now we should be able to run
```
./first
```

to output the returnvalue when running:
```
./first; echo $?
```

looks like return value is stored in r0
