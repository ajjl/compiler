Github repo available at:
https://github.com/ajjl/compiler

This repo should update automatically with new svn commits. So you could just
commit on svn and see the results on github.

Below is how you could setup your own git svn repo

Detailed info on git svn at: google it.

Basic git svn instrucitons -- works on mac (probably linux too)
you dont have to do this, you can just use svn if you want ...

1. Creating Repository
make a home for your new git svn repo on you computer:

"mkdir compilerStuff"
"cd compilerStuff"

use git svn to clone your repo:
"git svn clone https://svn.divms.uiowa.edu/repos/cs4980"

You now have a git-svn hybred repository!!

2. Go into your repository and check stuff out:
"cd cs4980"
"git log"
....

3. Add the github remote, and update the github repo:
"git remote add github https://github.com/path/to/your/remote"
"git fetch github"
"git push github master"

4. Make a change and commit it:
"echo 'something' >> groupc/testFile"

You need to commit in git first, then svn <------IMPORTANT
"git add groupc/testFile"
"git commit -m"Testing stuff"
"git svn dcommit"

5. Push your changes to github
"git push github master"

6. Probably more
git svn rebase ??

7. Notes:
you need to make your commits on svn yourself or the author wont show up.
